I'm is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Operations and Information Management at the Isenberg School of Management, UMass Amherst. I'm interested in the study of decision making, video games, and combining those two things together. My research has been published in the _European Journal of Information Systems_ and the proceedings of the _International Conference on Information Systems._ I teach Business Intelligence and Analytics to undergrads and in the full-time MBA program. I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota and was advised by Dr. Shawn Curley.

I'm originally from San Diego, California, where in my early years I administered the volunteer program for EverQuest for Sony Online Entertainment (now Daybreak Games Company) and as an actuarial assistant. I went to the University of California, San Diego where I got my BA in History. I also hold an MBA with a focus in international finance from the Thunderbird School of Global Management.
