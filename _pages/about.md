I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Operations and Information Management at the Isenberg School of Management, UMass Amherst. I'm interested in the study of decision making, video games, and combining those two things together. My research has been published in the  _Journal of the Association for Information Systems_, the _European Journal of Information Systems_ and _AIS Transactions on Information Systems_, among others. I teach Business Intelligence and Analytics to undergraduates and in the full-time MBA program. I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management and was advised by Dr. Shawn Curley.

I grew up in San Diego, California, where in my early years I administered the volunteer program for EverQuest for Sony Online Entertainment (now Daybreak Games Company) and as an actuarial assistant. I attended the University of California, San Diego where I got my BA in History, and additionally I hold an MBA with a focus in international finance from the Thunderbird School of Global Management.

I have very strong opinions about personnel decisions made by the San Diego Padres, the advice given by Mary Worth, and business models in the video games industry. I have no strong opinion in any direction regarding the deployment of the Oxford comma.
