I teach Business Intelligence and Analytics at the Undergraduate (OIM 350) and Graduate (SCH-MGMT 602) level.

Some assorted excerpts from teaching evaluations:

- _Professor Sheffler's teaching style and class are one of the best I have taken. I have learned so much more in this class than various classes taken with other professors. He responds quickly to questions and is very dedicated to helping students_

- _I loved learning about ERDplus & SQL. I learned so many different useful programs that I know will help me in the future, and through my experiences learning these in this class I was able to get an internship with a company I really like so I really enjoyed this course._

- _Professor Sheffler does a great job of explaining any points of  confusion and is also really approachable and willing to help._
