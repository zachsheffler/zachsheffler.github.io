My research investigates the intersection of information systems and decision making. I approach this question by a number of different angles:

## Gamification

How do the design elements that are common in games affect a decision maker's thought process? I explore the utilization of features that are taken from game design elements, such as points, leaderboards, and badges (or achievements/trophies) across a number of contexts.

### ...and wellness

The primary thrust of my gamification research has been in wellness. In collaboration with University Parking and Transportation services, my coauthors and I ran a large-scale field experiment with several thousand bicycle riders at a large campus and tested various badge designs (["Ingredients for successful badges: evidence from a field experiment in bike commuting"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0960085X.2020.1808539), _European Journal of Information Systems_, 2020), as well as offering different reward levels (["Do We Need Diff e Need Different Levels of Badges for Users with Different Participation Levels? A Field Experiment from a Bicycle Commuting Program"](https://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2019/behavior_is/behavior_is/22/), _International Conference on Information Systems_, 2019).

Other work in this space includes the application of lightweight online support to the wellness context (currently under review).

## Product Reviews

In the online shopping context, decision making processes are wildly different when compared to brick-and-mortar stores, especially when choosing between products. Absent an ability to physically interact with a product, product reviews become crucial for decision-making.

Here, I engage in two primary streams of research. First is determining trust in a review ([Biased but Credible: An Experimental Study of Online Reviews](https://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2020/hci_artintel/hci_artintel/15/), _International Conference on Information Systems_, 2020).
