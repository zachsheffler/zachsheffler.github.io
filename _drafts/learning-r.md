## What is R?

## Why Learn R?

## Who uses R?



## How do I get started using R?

At the risk of stating the obvious, you must [download R](https://cloud.r-project.org/). When you install the language, it will also install a very basic usage environment. You can use that, but I strongly recommend you use a developer environment. If you're an experienced programmer and you have a preferred text editor, you can also use that.

For most people (even programmers), I believe the best entry point to R is through [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com), which runs on all common desktop platforms. 

If you're an Isenberg student, RStudio is installed on lab computers and the virtual computer lab. If you have access to any other college computer lab, it's probable that lab has RStudio on it, too.
